Functions:
D_SS.m: distributed sensor selection and speech enhancement
D_SD.m: distributed steepest descent algorithm
steer_vec_gene_20nodes.m  :  Generate athe steering vector according to source and node positions
Vad_thr: VAD function, since the VAD is not the focus of this algorithm, 
the input signal without noise is assumed to be known only in VAD procedure.

Data:
avec_a_20nodes.mat: amplitude of steering vector
avec_tao_20nodes.mat: phase of steering vector
D_matrex.mat : distance matrix among nodes
rt300.nat: RIR generated by IMAGE Source method when RT60=300 ms
speech_femal.wav: input clean speech
xout.wav: Output signal

Environment: Matlab(2017a)
